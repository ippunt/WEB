Just documenting things I have learned. 

The first thing I want to go after is the scan reporting the cookie does not have HttpOnly Flag or the SameSite attribute.
HttpOnly cookie can be accessed via javascript. Run Java script on the page to push coookie elsewhere. Need apache running on cali to capture.
SameSite Cookie can be sent as a result of a 'Cross-site' request. CSRF.
