1. What if there is a wildcard DNS entry. We can use host list against domain due to IP result being one IP. 
2. If wget gave us all unique information. Nothing leading to unique hosts. We might want to look at titles or different data. To find real pages.




1.  for i in $(cat vhosts.list); do wget -0- --no-verbose http://$i.mydomain.local 1> /dev/null 2>>vhosts.real.txt; done
  now if the subdomain at $i resolves things for all hosts we will need to look for a unque identifer in the file.
  One tequnique may be to look for a particular field and find where it is unique
  grep -v might be helpful. 
  
2. curl -s http://hostname.mydomain.local| grep "<title>"
   curl -s http://hostname2.mydomain.local| grep "<title>"
 Here we have to ensure something is consistent vs unique about the default web page vs a real one. 
 
for i in $(cat vhosts.list); 
  do title=$(curl -s http://hostname.mydomain.local| grep "<title>"| cut -d\> -f2| cut -d\< -f1);
  
if [["$title" != "$i.mydomain.local"]]; 
  then echo "$i.mydomain.local"; 
  fi;
  done;
